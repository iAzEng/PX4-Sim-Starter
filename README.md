# PX4-Sim-Starter
A complete starter guide for setting up PX4, configuring Gazebo and jMAVSim simulations, adding GZ models and worlds, integrating ROS Humble.
### We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
If you are currently on Windows, we strongly suggest setting up a dual-boot system for the best development experience. Here is a helpful YouTube guide on how to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu.

If you're using a Mac, it's perfectly fine to run Ubuntu in a virtual machine. We recommend using UTM. Here is a helpful YouTube guide on how to set up an Ubuntu 22.04 VM:
